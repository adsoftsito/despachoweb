It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n     * done.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n     * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function\n     * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n     * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting\n     * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.\n     *\n     * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called\n     * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output\n     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n     * something went wrong.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n     *\n     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n     *\n     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n     *\n     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n     * of returned function, when it is called.\n     *\n     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n     *\n     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n     * import * as fs from 'fs';\n     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>\n     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n     *   console.log(err); // null\n     *   console.log(a); // 5\n     *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(value => {\n     *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>\n     * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n     *   console.log(err); // undefined\n     *   console.log(a); // \"abc\"\n     *   console.log(b); // \"DEF\"\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction, (a, b) => a + b);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(value => {\n     *   console.log(value); // \"abcDEF\"\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>\n     * someFunction(a => {\n     *   console.log(a); // 5\n     * });\n     * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n     * boundSomeFunction()\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   value => {}             // never gets called\n     *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n     *);\n     *\n     *\n     * @see {@link bindCallback}\n     * @see {@link from}\n     * @see {@link fromPromise}\n     *\n     * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n     * @param {function} [selector] A function which takes the arguments from the\n     * callback and maps those to a value to emit on the output Observable.\n     * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n     * callbacks.\n     * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n     * Observable that delivers the same values the Node.js callback would\n     * deliver.\n     * @static true\n     * @name bindNodeCallback\n     * @owner Observable\n     */\n    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.create = function (func, selector, scheduler) {\n        if (selector === void 0) { selector = undefined; }\n        return function () {\n            var args = [];\n            for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n                args[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n            }\n            return new BoundNodeCallbackObservable(func, selector, args, this, scheduler);\n        };\n    };\n    BoundNodeCallbackObservable.prototype._subscribe = function (subscriber) {\n        var callbackFunc = this.callbackFunc;\n        var args = this.args;\n        var scheduler = this.scheduler;\n        var subject = this.subject;\n        if (!scheduler) {\n            if (!subject) {\n                subject = this.subject = new AsyncSubject_1.AsyncSubject();\n                var handler = function handlerFn() {\n                    var innerArgs = [];\n                    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n                        innerArgs[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n                    }\n                    var source = handlerFn.source;\n                    var selector = source.selector, subject = source.subject;\n                    var err = innerArgs.shift();\n                    if (err) {\n                        subject.error(err);\n                    }\n                    else if (selector) {\n                        var result_1 = tryCatch_1.tryCatch(selector).apply(this, innerArgs);\n                        if (result_1 === errorObject_1.errorObject) {\n                            subject.error(errorObject_1.errorObject.e);\n                        }\n                        else {\n                            subject.next(result_1);\n                            subject.complete();\n                        }\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        subject.next(innerArgs.length <= 1 ?

So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 1146\n// module chunks = 0 1 2","\"use strict\";\nvar concat_1 = require('../operator/concat');\nexports.concat = concat_1.concatStatic;\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 1147\n// module chunks = 0 1 2","\"use strict\";\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 1148\n// module chunks = 0 1 2","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
